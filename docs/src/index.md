# SetProg

[SetProg](https://github.com/blegat/SetProg.jl) is a JuMP extension for Set Programming :
optimization with set variables and inclusion/containment constraints.
This package allows the formulation of a mathematical programming involving both classical variables and constraints supported by JuMP and set variables and constraints.
